# bit-twiddling

This project implements some cool bit twiddling hacks to allow huge performance gains.
It can be beneficial in SDR, HPC or any compute-heavy tasks done in software.

It is largely inspired by [Stanford Sean Eron Anderson bithacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)
